Hi Michael Gary Scott,
Thank you for your interest in Amazon! The next step of the application process is the online assessment. The assessment that you are about to complete is an important part of the hiring process to help us learn more about you. Please complete this online assessment in the next two weeks. If you do not complete it, you will not move forward in the hiring process.
Before beginning your online assessment, please review the following instructions and helpful hints:
 Do not click the ‘Start the assessment’ link below until you are ready to start and complete the assessment.
 Please complete the assessment as soon as possible.
 Take the assessment in a quiet, distraction-free environment.
 Set aside 50-60 minutes in a place where you can focus to give yourself plenty of time to complete the assessment.
 Ensure you have a reliable internet connection during the assessment.
 While you are able to use a mobile device to take the assessment, we recommend completing it on a larger screen such as a tablet, laptop or desktop computer.
 You can find more information on assessments at Amazon here:
 https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/assessments
 If you need an accommodation, more information can be found here: https://www.amazon.jobs/en/disability/us
 After completing the assessment, you can take an optional feedback survey.
 You will know you have completed the entire assessment when you see the confirmation page at the end.
To begin your assessment, use the link below:
Start My Assessment
Note: This link is unique to you.
Troubleshooting
 For any technical issues, refer to the troubleshooting guides in the assessment. If those do not work, examine closely where you left off, log out, and log back in using the link above. Please do not repeatedly refresh the screen.
 If technical issues cannot be resolved, please contact your recruiter immediately.
We recognize this is a large time investment. We value the people we hire and we appreciate your interest in Amazon. You will be contacted in the event we decide to move forward with your application.
FAQs
Want to catch a glimpse of what it is like working at Amazon?
 You can refer to amazon.jobs.
How can I best prepare for the assessment?
 Review the Assessments page on Amazon.jobs. Setting aside an appropriate amount of time and finding a quiet location will be important. Do not forget that a strong Internet connection is also key.
I cannot complete the online assessment within the number of days allocated. May I request an extension?
 Yes; however, Amazon hires on a rolling basis and a delay in completing the online assessment may impact your candidacy. If you require an extension, please email your recruiter and our team will follow up within three business days of your email.
Can I take a break during the assessment?
 Sure! We suggest taking a short break in between evaluation modules or sections. Stretch, move around or grab a glass of water before finishing the rest of the assessment. You don’t need to log out to take a quick break. If for some reason you do need to interrupt your session and log out, you can click on the “Start the assessment” link to log back in and resume.
What should I do, if due to a disability, I require accommodation prior to starting the assessment?
 Our inclusive culture empowers Amazonians to deliver the best results for our customers. We not only celebrate the diversity of our workforce, we celebrate the diverse ways we work in. If you have a disability and need an accommodation, please reach out to your recruiter or click on this link for more information, https://www.amazon.jobs/en/disability/us.
What should I do if I experience technical issues?
 For any technical issues, refer to the troubleshooting guides in the assessment. If those do not work, examine closely where you left off, log out and log back in using the link above. Please do not repeatedly refresh the screen. If technical issues cannot be resolved, please contact your recruiter immediately.

Thank you for applying to the Data Analyst position. While this letter is automatically generated, our candidate review process is not. Here's what will happen next:
People, not robots read your resume. People who know about the position review each resume that is submitted to us.
Our goal is to have your resume reviewed within two weeks of submitting it to us.
If you're selected to move to the next stage of the interview process, a recruiter will reach out to conduct a preliminary phone screening.
If you're not selected for an interview, please know there are most likely several factors that influenced our decision. One major influencer is unfortunately out of your control - the strength of our candidate pool. Oftentimes, you may have good to great professional experience, but we have to send a rejection because of the level of competition for the role is so high.
Thank you again for submitting your resume for our review. We will make every effort to provide you with consistent communication during your candidacy with us, regardless of the outcome.
Please keep in mind, a QuinStreet Recruiter will never ask you to purchase equipment or ask for any personal information (ie - bank information, deposit checks, personal identity number, government identification) and will only receive email communication from our domains, @quinstreet.com and/or @us.greenhouse-mail.io.

Thank you for applying to the Product Data Analyst with us. We appreciate the time you’ve taken to apply for the role and look forward to reviewing your application.
 
We know it can be exciting and scary applying for a job, so here is what you can expect next! 
 
Application Review. It will happen. As we sometimes get upwards of 100+ applications for some roles, it can take some time, but every applicant can expect a note regarding their application status.
 
Interview Selection. If we don’t set up a call for this job, don’t worry. It doesn’t mean you’re not a great fit for us, it just means that sometimes there is a lot of competition for a great job.
 
Interview Process. Every role starts the same, an introductory call with someone from our Recruitment team. We will be looking for company and values-fit as well as your professional experience; there may be some technical role-specific questions during this call. 
 
Every role is different after the initial call, but you can expect to meet several people from the team 1:1 and there might be further skill assessments in the form of a Take Home Assignment/Case Study Presentation or Pair Programming/Live Coding exercise depending on the role. In your initial call, we will walk you through exactly what to expect the process to be.
 
Where We Interview: Currently interviews are being conducted virtually, but for candidates that are comfortable and interested, we have started meeting people in our offices.
 
Transparency. We appreciate and value your time, so we try to make the on-site interview process as efficient as possible. Before every interview, you will receive a note letting you know what to expect as well as who you will be meeting.
 
Good luck and speak soon,
Talent Team @ Flywheel Digital

Greetings from the GoodRx mothership. We're super-pumped that you share our passion for fixing America's broken healthcare system, and we'd very much like to see you as our next Data Engineer Internship.
We make sure to review all applications, except for the ones written completely in crayon, because current laws prohibit us from hiring 3-year-olds. We plan to schedule interviews in the next few weeks once we've been able to review submitted resumes and get our business pants back from the dry cleaner. 
We promise to get back to you because that's the nice thing to do. If there's not a fit, we promise to email and let you know. If we're feeling that special tingle, one of our recruiters will email you to schedule a preliminary phone interview. Now would be a good time to practice your favorite karaoke song. 
In any case, we will keep you posted on the status of your application.
Thank you, again, for taking the first step!
