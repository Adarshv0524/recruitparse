# RecruitAI: Smart Recruitment Email Assistant

RecruitAI is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to automatically sift through your inbox, identify recruitment-related emails, and extract key information into a structured, easy-to-view format. Stop manually tracking job opportunities and let AI do the heavy lifting for you.

## The Problem

Are you overwhelmed by the sheer volume of job opportunity emails? Manually reading each one, pulling out deadlines, job titles, and application links is a tedious and error-prone process. Important opportunities can get lost in the noise, and tracking them becomes a chore.

## The Solution

This project offers an intelligent, on-device solution to manage your recruitment emails efficiently. The app automatically processes your emails, identifies which ones are job-related, and extracts crucial details, presenting them in a clean and organized dashboard. All processing happens locally on your device, ensuring your data remains private.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Email Classification:** Intelligently detects whether an incoming email is related to a job opportunity or not.
- **Key Information Extraction:** Automatically pulls out essential details from emails, including:
    - Job Title and Company Name
    - Salary / Compensation details
    - Application Deadlines and other important dates
    - Location (including remote options)
    - Required Skills
    - Direct Application Links
- **Organized Dashboard:** View all your opportunities in a structured list, sorted and filtered for easy access.
- **Privacy First:** All email processing and data extraction happen entirely on your device. Your personal data never leaves your phone.
- **Automated Reminders:** Get notifications for upcoming application deadlines so you never miss an opportunity.

## How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful workflow:

1. **Connect & Sync:** Securely connects to your email account to fetch new messages.
2. **Identify:** An on-device machine learning model analyzes the content to identify recruitment emails.
3. **Extract:** For relevant emails, the system uses a combination of AI and pattern recognition to pull out structured data.
4. **Display:** The extracted information is saved locally and presented in a user-friendly dashboard for you to review and act upon.
